What am I focused on at this point in life?

Updated 30th December 2025, from Pune, India.

 Research & Work
---

My life is currently centered around the development of **AURA**, my emotionally intelligent wearable AI companion. I'm deep-diving into DistilBERT for on-device sentiment analysis and implementing FAISS for episodic memory on constraints like the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

As the founder of **SOHAI LABS**, I'm also spending time mentoring juniors in my college and delivering AI/ML solutions for local businesses. It's incredibly rewarding to see theoretical concepts come to life in the hands of students.

I'm also preparing for my **AWS AI/ML Udacity Nanodegree** as an AWS Scholar, focusing on Generative AI and cloud-based ML pipelines.

 Community & Learning
---

I'm actively participating in the **Google/Eduskills** community following my internship, and I'm looking for ways to further democratize access to AI education in Pune. 

I'm also learning more about **Material Design 3** and **Framer** to ensure my AI research has a premium, user-friendly interface.

 Philosophy
---

I've been thinking a lot about the balance between technical complexity and user experience. "Complexity should be hidden, not showcased." My goal is to build tools that feel like magic but are grounded in rigorous science.

To keep my mind sharp, I enjoy exploring new prompt engineering techniques and tinkering with local LLM quantization.

 Pune
---

Living and working in Pune, the "Oxford of the East," provides a great environment for research and growth. I'm enjoying being close to the developer community here while building global-scale projects.

 Future
---

I'm aiming to present my work on AURA at upcoming tech conferences and research symposiums. The goal for 2026 is to have a fully functional prototype of OS-1 and AURA in the hands of users!
