# Soham Datta | AI Researcher Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio and research blog, built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). It focuses on emotionally intelligent systems, on-device ML, and human-centered design.

## Features
- **Project Showcase:** Highlights my work on AURA and OS-1.
- **Deep Bio:** My journey from Pune to the frontiers of AI.
- **"Now" Page:** A real-time update of my current focuses and research.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** A technical, monochrome design optimized for reading.
