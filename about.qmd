## **Me in 10 seconds**

I’m an AI Researcher specializing in emotionally intelligent systems at the intersection of on-device ML and human-centered design. I build privacy-first AI that adapts to emotional context without cloud dependency.

Currently, I'm the Founder of SOHAI LABS and an AWS AI/ML Scholar, pursuing my B.E. in AI & ML at the University of Pune.

Pune native, I'm building the future of local, empathetic intelligence!

## **Me in 10 Minutes**

I’m a creative technologist who believes that the next frontier of AI isn't just "smarter" but "more empathetic." My work focuses on bridging the gap between raw compute and human emotion. I've been researching on-device models that can perceive and respond to user sentiment in real-time, ensuring that intelligence remains personal and private.

I recently completed an AI/ML internship at Google/Eduskills, where I optimized computer vision models for edge devices, achieving significant accuracy gains. I've also automated complex HR workflows for Reliance Industries using LLMs, proving that even at scale, AI can make operations more human-centric.

My "hero project," AURA, is a wearable AI companion that uses local semantic memory and sentiment analysis to provide context-aware support. I'm also conceptualizing OS-1, an AI-native operating system designed to rethink how we interact with information.

I’m always open to research collaborations, particularly in the realms of Edge ML, Affective Computing, and RAG systems. Drop me a line on LinkedIn ([Soham Datta](https://linkedin.com/in/sohamdatta-ai/)), and let's build something meaningful! ;)
